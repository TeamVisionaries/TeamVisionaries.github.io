						<h2>Huynh Minh Phat</h2>
						<div class="content_indence"><p>As a member in a team, I had completed all the work which the group had given me. I had missed two group meetings in a row and caused some missed information. This act has delayed my group progress, so I will try to have more face-to-face meetings with my group more frequently. The first thing which surprised me at the beginning is that similar ideas. For instance, the idea of our project about RMIT E-wallet came from my project idea and my team leader’s project idea. This had helped our group get on the project a little bit faster. The second surprise from this project is that group members' attitude. In other words, members in my group are responsible for their work and completed on time. Thanks to my group, I had more ideas about blockchain technology. For example, my group leader had told me about some fundamental mechanics of this technology and the blockchain area is also my curiosity from last assignment. The second thing which I had learned from my group is teamwork. Thanks to teamwork, my project was improved in its concept. My original idea did not include printing service and blockchain technology. Overall, my group helped me to fulfill my project idea.</p></div>

						<h2>Nguyen Phuoc Quang Liem</h2>
						<div class="content_indence"><p>As we just started forming our group a week before Christmas break. But the amount of work that the team has to deliver has given me an excellent and comfortable feeling of working on the assignment. And since I’m the oldest in the group and have experience working in the group before. The group has voted to allow me to become the leader. That has given me the courage to take the spot and delivered a satisfying experience to the team. But due to the workload that I have to do from other project as my team members either dropped out of the course at last minute or were so lost during the course has limited my times to contribute to balance out between this assignment and another project. After discussing with my team in this assignment, the team was happy to help me with a few things in the assignment, so I could spend a bit more time working on my other project.</p></div>
						<div class="hr-hor-line animate-box"></div>
						<h2>Do Minh Huy</h2>
						<div class="content_indence"><p>Sticking with the group for quite some time, my connection with the group has improved a lot. Thanks to our project idea from the start are quite similar, our group though start the final project a little late from other group but still manage to finish on time. I can not mention enough the great effort that the team members have put into the project. Although, I still think that it would be better if we have more face to face meeting to discuss and improve the project ideas. While doing the project, the team members have brought me many surprising things and one of which is their attitude this helps me to have a more welcome view about teamwork. This helps me to realize the benefit of choosing the right teammates. Another thing that I have learned is the ability to manage a team from my leader Liem, this would definitely help in the future. Overall, I hope that in the future I could find groups that have a similar corporate environment like this one and I would be happy to work with them on other projects.</p></div>

						<h2>Nguyen Chi Thien Phuc</h2>
						<div class="content_indence"><p>After a long period of time carrying out this assignment with my team, I have had many experience in collaboration, discussion and time management. Firstly, I am very happy with the process of it because everything was seemed to be in order. We had found the most suitable time when we could all meet and then we had a meetings every weeks which last for 3 to 5 hours. After discussing about the idea carefully, the whole assignment was divided into several parts assigned to each of member of our team. In my opinion, all of our teammate not only tried their best to finish their tasks on schedule, but also usually helped each other to fix some errors. Therefor, I have learned about the importance of team work that made us carry out the assignment faster and more efficiently. The thing surprised me the most is the way the team divided the work and got it done smoothly without any disagreement while working.</p></div>
