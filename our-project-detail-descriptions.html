						<h2>Aims</h2>
						<div class="content_indence">
							<p>In general, the main aim of this project is RMIT E-wallet. We will utilize ID cards and ID numbers as keys to access school accounts and use their balance. In other words, with ID cards and ID numbers, staff and students can use all on-campus features and services such as print machines, bookstore payment, food court payment, parking service, tuition fee payment. To fulfill our main aim, we will break it into two smaller goals: on-campus service stage and the RMIT E-wallet stage. Each step will aim at a specific purpose.</p>
						</div>	
						<div class="content_img"><img src="images/e-wallet.jpg"></div>
						<div class="content_indence">
							<p>The first goal is on-campus service, which includes printing service and parking service. Firstly, we will allow students and staff access to their school account and use printing services without cash. Secondly, staff and students will need their ID cards to use parking service. To put in other words, to use the parking service, they will scan their ID cards through the parking meter at the main entrance to get into the parking area.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="content_img"><img src="images/e-wallet2.png"></div>
						<div class="content_indence">
							<p>The following goal of our project is RMIT E-wallet. In this stage, we will provide the UIs for users to do some stuff on it. In other words, we will allow students and staff to pay for other on-campus services such as on-campus bookstores, food court, and tuition fees. We will be able to pay for these services with QR code or ID cards. If they pay by QR code, they must install RMIT E-wallet apps. Otherwise, they must swipe their ID cards through the swiping machine at locations to use services.</p>

						<h2>Plan and Progress</h2>
						<div class="content_indence"><p>For parking service and printing service: At the beginning of each semester, students and staff can apply for parking and printing packages with fixed prices. This feature will allow students and staff to use these two services endlessly through a semester. After they pay for the package, their ID card will be activated and work as a parking card with a parking service. Whenever they use the parking service on the campus, they need to scan the ID card through the main entrance parking meter. Similarly, after students and staff pay for the package, they need to use their school account to pay for each copy whenever they want to use print machines. If they're going to use these features next semester, they can reactivate them with their school accounts.</p></div>
						<div class="content_img"><img src="images/qr-code.png"></div>
						<div class="content_indence"><p>For tuition payment: Thanks to RMIT E-wallet, students can use their school accounts to pay for their tuition fees and insurance fees. After paying their tuition school accounts, they will receive a confirmation email or text message if the transaction was successful.</p></div>
						<div class="content_indence"><p>For on-campus services: this feature will help to activate an ID card as an on-campus bank card. Before using on-campus services such as bookstore and food court service, students and staff must add funds to the RMIT E-wallet. There are two ways to add funds to the RMIT E-wallet. The first way to add funds is by entering the school website, log in to their school accounts, and add funds by credit cards or debit cards. The second way to add funds is using an app. To use this way, students and staff must install the RMIT E-wallet on their phone or tablet. Then, logging in to an app by student ID, after reaching the main screen of an app, find the add funds section and add funds by credit card or debit card through an app. Whenever students and staff need to use on-campus services, they can either use their ID cards or personal device to scan QR code to pay for the services.</p></div>
						<div class="content_img"><img src="images/id-card.jpg"></div>
						<h3>Cybersecurity and Privacy</h3>
						<div class="content_indence"><p>The first element is cybersecurity and privacy. The functions of cybersecurity and privacy will help to keep user's money safe in their RMIT E-wallet. The term cybersecurity and privacy are incredibly familiar with computer users. This technology is created to protect users' information, especially their personal data. The art of cybersecurity and privacy is based on lock-and-key mechanism. Specifically, both users' information and money in the RMIT E-wallet will be protected by "the lock." "The lock" here is the scan station and card reader. "The keys" are the ID numbers and ID cards of users. In the cybersecurity part, we will break it into three stages: starter, advancement, and completion.</p></div>
						<div class="content_indence"><p>At the starter stage, to guarantee this feature, cybersecurity software will be our priority. We will use trustworthy software at a reasonable price, which is available by now, such as Bitdefender, Intruder, etc. Top security software will be our choice to guarantee user's information and money. In this "primary" stage, we utilize the convenience of current security software to reduce time-consuming. This act also works for cost-saving at the beginning. At this stage, every access from users' needs to use ID cards and ID numbers.</p></div>
						<div class="content_indence"><p>While this project is in progress and our financial condition is better, we will work on our security system. At this stage, we will write a security program for ourselves and stop using other company products. This act will help for cost-saving and give us a better chance in the future to debug the security gaps. This progress will be applied at the second stage of the whole progress. Moreover, we will not have to depend on other company products. At this stage, users still use their ID Card and ID number to access their school account. In general, we will make our system independent. </p></div>
						<div class="content_img"><img src="images/cybersecurity.jpg"></div>
						<div class="content_indence"><p>At the completion stage, we will apply biometrics technology into our security system. Biometrics will be the last progress of our project. In general, biometrics is a technology that uses human physical characteristics and human behavior to identify the users’ identities. This feature will work as a “living ID card,” and fingerprint will work as a “key” instead of a card. In other words, in this stage, we will allow students and staff to use their fingerprints to access their account both at card reader for on-campus services and scan station for parking service. This act will help to advance our security system because biometrics is much more accurate than cards. If this stage is enabled in the future, cards will be removed from our security system and replaced by fingerprints.</p></div>
						<div class="content_indence"><p>Both the starter stage and advancement stage are the potential to be finished as soon as possible. With our current technology, both steps are likely to be worked on. The most challenging stage is the third stage, biometrics still quite strange for us, and it takes time to finish. It is a challenge for us, but it is possible to start and deal with it. Many companies have used biometrics for their security system, such as Apple with Face ID and fingerprint, Google with fingerprint lock, etc. Both companies have given a positive result with their products. And biometrics will be the next level of security for users in the future. Biometrics in our system aims to minimize security gaps as much as possible.</p></div>

						<h3>Blockchain</h3>
						<div class="content_indence"><p>Blockchain: In our project, blockchain works as the brain of the entire system. To complete a transaction through an app from a personal device or ID card, blockchain must go through some steps to finish the transaction. Firstly, blockchain will receive a requested transaction at the local card reader – food court and bookstore. Then, the computer will check for authentication, specifically ID numbers. The last step, after identifying the users’ information, transaction will come to completion. Advantages of Blockchain: with blockchain, the number of scan stations and card readers is unlimited. This feature will be feasible on campus. The second advantage of blockchain is efficiency. This system helps to do transactions faster than using cash and credit cards. Students and staff only need to scan QR code through card reader and scan station. The other advantage of this technology is that information in blockchain is immutable. In other words, once the transaction has been made, it cannot be returned. Disadvantages of blockchain: Private key is one of many barriers which blockchain must deal with. In other words, if users lose their ID cards, they cannot access the Uni wallet and use their funds in the wallet. With this technical issue, at the current time, we will use an ID number as a private key which helps users keep their money safer. In the future, specifically, at the last stage of the security system, we will use fingerprints as private keys so it will not be a barrier for users anymore.</p></div>
						<div class="content_img"><img src="images/blockchain.jpg"></div>
						<div class="content_indence"><p>The second part of this project is Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies technology. In the most straightforward words, Blockchain is a tool that helps users to store their money in e-wallet. Cryptocurrencies are the funds that students and staff add to their Uni wallet.</p></div>

						<h3>Cryptocurrencies</h3>
						<div class="content_indence"><p>Cryptocurrencies are the only currency users can use to do transactions through ID cards and personal devices. In other words, after users add funds to their Uni wallet, this amount of money will be transferred to cryptocurrency and will be used in the future. Advantages of cryptocurrencies: With cryptocurrency, transactions will be more feasible. In some cases, this feature also helps to avoid banking fees if users usually use online banking.</p></div>
						<div class="content_indence"><p>Finally, the school will control this currency, and it will be appropriate for small and medium-scale campuses. Disadvantages of cryptocurrency: the most severe gap in cryptocurrency is cybersecurity. This gap becomes more severe because of the large scale of business. With this technical issue, it will be less severe between our project only work on a small scale and medium scale. Moreover, at the last stage, we will apply biometrics as authentication methods for users to solve this problem.</p></div>

						<h2>Roles</h2>
						<div class="content_indence"><p>Our group started this project in week nine, and by then, we didn't identify positions for any of the team members except Liem as our Team Leader. Since week 10, since this project concept is focused on Phat assignment two and many of our project's changes are based on his suggestion, Ideas Developer would be a perfect role in this assignment. At week 11, when our group focused on creating an application prototype and website for our project, we assign Phuc as a UI Developer and Huy as a Web Developer.</p></div>
