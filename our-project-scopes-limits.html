						<h1>Scopes and Limits</h1>
						<div class="content_indence"><p>As mentioned above, with all the capabilities of our project that we would like to see in the future, is obviously quite ambitious. The central concept is to build a system that can manage user's transaction history and allow users to make payments around the campus quickly. From there, we want to make sure users will have a good experience of all the features embedded in our application. The application will be available on Android Operating System (OS) and iPhone Operating System, which meets our project idea. Parts of the Application will be listed from the highest priority to the lowest.</p></div>
						<div class="content_img_2"><img src="images/prototype1.png"></div>
						<div class="content_indence"><p>Our primary aim of the project is to minimize the number of school web pages and reduce students' time when accessing school facilities. Therefore, our main application page will certainly incorporate all school news, club news, and confessions so that you, as a user, don't have to search your email to see future activities, and the admin on the RMIT Facebook page can directly handle the details from our application. Second, the key feature of our team project is to be able to use QR to pay practically anything on campus, from food in the canteen, grocery store to parking tickets and future purposes.</p></div>
						<div class="content_img_2"><img src="images/prototype2.png"></div>
						<div class="content_indence"><p>In addition to encouraging students to borrow books from the library and reduce the process of scheduling or booking appointment times, this feature helps students to book a meeting room or appointment with the Teacher, SAS support, and PAL team, etc. To experience real convenience, you can build a student account and conveniently check the account's balance or top-up the account through third-party applications such as Momo, ZaloPay, bank transfer or credit card, etc. Our system also has various features that concentrate on study purposes that support students on our campus, such as monitoring class notifications, so students can see news and updates from teachers and classes to discuss and track class schedules. Finally, for users to secure and personalize their accounts, our application can change their personal information such as password, profile image, etc.</p></div>
						<div class="content_indence"><p>With such a complex and limitation on the project, both time and lack of knowledge have challenged us through many obstacles in creating a perfect system with both front-end and secure databases. The deeper we scope into the project, the more things that need to be added to the project.</p></div>

						<h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
						<div class="content_indence"><p>There will be two main groups of tools and technologies which are required for the project: Languages; Software and hardware.</p></div>
						<h3>Languages</h3>
						<div class="content_indence"><p>The fluency in five programming languages below is highly recommended for our project because each language will play its significant role: HTML, SQL, Python, Java, C/C++.</p></div>
						<div class="content_indence"><p>•	The first language is HTML. Being able to work with this language will allow us to create websites and webpages for our platform. </p></div>
						<div class="content_img"><img src="images/html.png"></div>
						<div class="content_indence"><p>•	SQL will help us to control relational databases and stream processing in our system. </p></div>
						<div class="content_img"><img src="images/sql.jpg"></div>
						<div class="content_indence"><p>•	Python has a huge set of libraries that make it fit for AI, data science, etc. (Python 3.1 at least)</p></div>
						<div class="content_img"><img src="images/python.png"></div>
						<div class="content_indence"><p>•	Java has a library which supports for the UI.</p></div>
						<div class="content_img"><img src="images/java.jpg"></div>
						<div class="content_indence"><p>•	C/C++ is a fast and compiled language. (C90(1990) at least)</p></div>
						<div class="content_img"><img src="images/c++.webp"></div>
						<h3>Software and Hardware</h3>
						<div class="content_indence"><p>•	Read-a-card software: JAVA card version 2.1(1999)</p></div>
						<div class="content_indence"><p>•	Scan station and swiping machine: Presto model from IEM group and Wisepos model from Mswipe.</p></div>
						<div class="content_indence"><p>•	Cybersecurity software: Bitdefender Total Security Package</p></div>
						<div class="content_img"><img src="images/bitfender.jpeg"></div>

						<h2>Testing</h2>
						<div class="content_indence"><p>To get started with testing, we will see if there is a unit testing framework already available for our language, and then we can quickly come up with a body of tests for the individual units. Then, we will do performance tests. They are almost exclusively automated, though any easy way to do performance testing is simply to time our automated system tests and watch the trends, and also watch system metrics such as CPU and memory utilization while our system tests are running. We will also do a system check to see if the individual units work together. If all three tests are done well, our project is successful. After our project application system has gone through all the stress tests we mention above; the next step is to assign a group of users to range from 10 to 20 RMIT students to test out the applications for a period between 4 to 6 weeks to allow the users to experience the interface and to see if they encounter any bugs or errors so we can go back to the report from each user and fix the issues.</p></div>

						<h2>Risks</h2>
						<div class="content_indence">Our group project, in long-term development, can occur many dilemmas. As user security is the most essential factor when developing a database application, this brings us the first problem is how we remain a cybersecurity system to guarantee user benefit? Biometrics authentication could be the answer to that question, however, for future development, it requires us to have a huge amount of knowledge about that subject. Secondly, though we have mentioned above that blockchain technology, however, there will always a delay in the transaction. This requires the system to take time and effort to provide a payment gateway for users. When mentioning team members, as a first-semester student, our team did not have a close look at many tools. Therefore, we only have a basic concept of the agency that the course provides. Our team, though, can also finish the project on schedule as we try our best to overcome the situation in place.</p></div>

						<h2>Group progresses and Communications</h2>
						<div class="content_indence"><p>Understand the value of communication. Therefore, our team has used many methods to stay on track with the success of our participants. First of all, we have picked Trello as our group's primary instrument so that Liem, as our team leader, can separate and assign tasks to individual members. Second of all, we have decided that we will all use Microsoft word online from Outlook using the school's account. Finally, we all accept that we arrange face-to-face sessions twice per week to specify our group's way of handling the task. We also have each other's phone numbers to discourage the lack of keeping in touch so that we can communicate to avoid delay in the group project.</p></div>

						<h2>Skills and Jobs</h2>
						<div class="content_indence"><p>Business Analysis: Business analysis is a combination of gaining insight from data using specific techniques and performing tasks to identify a business's needs and then recommend changes and provide solutions that produce value for the stakeholders. Many solutions potentially have the software and digital data-based components and incorporate organizational changes, like improving processes, developing new policies, and engaging in strategic planning. Business analysts are agents of change—professionals who analyze a business or organization by documenting its systems and processes, assessing its business model, identifying vulnerabilities, and devising solutions. Hence, the business analysts not only need to have wide knowledge about their specialties but also some core skills such as communication skill, problem-solving skill, and critical thinking:

							a)	Because they have to ask the right questions, listen carefully, and absorb their customer's requirements, the business analysts must be good communicators.
							
							b)	No project is without problems, so they always have to prepare proactive solutions to solve them.
							
							c)	Business analysts must be the visionaries who can imagine how the future will be and evaluate multiple choices before helping their customers settle on a solution.
							
								They must listen to stakeholder needs and critically consider those needing probing questions until they are surfaced and understood.
							</p></div>
						<div class="content_indence"><p>Web Designer: A web designer is an IT professional responsible for designing a website's layout, visual appearance, and usability. A good web designer needs to have both creative graphic skills and technical skills. They need to visualize how a site will look (the site's graphical design) and how it will function (conversion of a format into a working website). Some of the skills usually associated with web designers are Good working knowledge of one or more of the following web designer packages, the ability to create compliant XHTML and CSS, not always using one of the packages shown above, understanding of scripting languages such as JavaScript, PHP and .NET is often desirable, strong creative skills.</p></div>
						<div class="content_indence"><p>Software developer: Software developers identify and correct existing software errors and modify them to higher functionality. They assist a company or customer in determining the practicality of cost constraints and a realistic time frame for their request. A software developer designs, develops and modifies software systems using mathematical models or scientific analysis. A software developer processes information by categorizing, coding, calculating, and tabulating, and verifying data. They do this by breaking down information into separate parts and identifying the software's underlying principles to serve the customer better. Therefore, they must have analytical skills, creativity, and innovation to match their improvements and creations to the users and the client's needs. Moreover, because this job often involves collaboration with the team, software developers should practice interpersonal and communication skills.</p></div>
						<div class="content_indence"><p>Cyber Security: identify threats and vulnerabilities in systems and software, then apply their skills to developing and implementing high-tech solutions to defend against hacking, malware and ransomware, insider threats, and all types of cybercrime. They’ll often serve as a go-to team member for security policies and procedures. Cybersecurity is a technology-focused field, so technological savvy to perform the daily activities of cybersecurity professionals. They should also know about security across various platforms and understand hacking to protect an organization's network and infrastructure effectively.</p></div>

						<h2>Feedbacks</h2>
						 <h3>Nguyen Phuoc Quang Liem</h3>
						 <div class="content_indence"><p>Phat has contributed the most to the team, from project ideas to completing his task that I was assigned him to work on. Due to some personal issues that he needs to deal with, he has missed two offline group meetings and caused a bit of miscommunication during the project discussion, but Phat did send me a message to inquire about the meeting that he missed out on. And he even offers to help us on the part that we still in the process of working on.</p></div>
						 <div class="content_indence"><p>Since Minh Huy is the youngest in the group and still new to the University environment, but he always gives all out to the tasks that he was assigned to work on. The knowledge that he’s having on working with tools and technology isn’t that good, but he always seeks help from PAL supports and from other team members has given him credit to be a worthy team member. </p></div>
						 <div class="content_indence"><p>On the other hand, Phuc is a bit shy when we have group meetings to discuss the assignment. And also, dues to family issues that he has been missed out few group meetings as well. And because of that, we helped him with a few tasks that he couldn’t be working on. Overall, If he shows a bit more contribution to the team would’ve made it much easier for the team.</p></div>
						 <h3>Huynh Minh Phat</h3>
						 <div class="content_indence"><p>In my group, Liem is not only the group leader, but also a supporter for entire group members. For example, he is always ready to help group members to fulfill their work. About Minh Huy, he worked as a technical advisor for our group. For instance, he would help us to set up and support website works. The last member in my group is Thien Phuc, he is an enthusiastic member in my group. He completely works with a hundred percent of his energy and always ready for later work. In this project, I think I had finished all of work which my group had gave to me, but I think I should attend more meetings with my group and give more opinion about the project.</p></div>
						 <h3>Minh Huy Do</h3>
						 <div class="content_indence"><p>Working for this group for around 8 weeks was quite a great pleasure of mine. Though at first, when assembling this group I was afraid that it would turn out to be the same as my Database group which is a disaster. Firstly, I was very please when Liem was my leader with his background graduated business management he was able to manage our team very well and he is also able to fix many grammar and structure mistakes in our report. Secondly, Phat I find as the most hardworking in this project as he tends to take care of a lot of writing report part for himself and finish it on time. Lastly, Phuc thought he was quite taciturn, he still happy to do the job that was assigned. About myself, I think that have done well all the work that was assigned but still, I wish I could improve more on my structure and vocabulary.</p></div>
						 <h3>Nguyen Chi Thien Phuc</h3>
						 <div class="content_indence"><p>After a while working together, I feel that this is a precious experience for me with the group. Our group have four people Quang Liem, Minh Phat, Minh Huy and me. While I was working with Liem, I could see that he has a great problem-solving skill. Because of having gone to different countries, he owns a wide range of knowledge enough for him to address complex issues effectively he just like a big brother to all of us. Personally, I feel that Phat is an active guy with full of energy every time I met him. He is consider as the connector of our group who always contribute ideas and communicate with all of members in a friendly way. It could be seen that Huy was very responsible to the team. He always tried his best to complete his task as soon as possible and was on time at every meetings. Moreover, he often took it seriously and did it.</p></div>
